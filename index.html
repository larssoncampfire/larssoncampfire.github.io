    <div class="w3-orange">
      <p class="fivews" style="margin-top:0px;padding-top:15px;">So Hans popped this <a href="https://media.tenor.com/images/4ab2809b691e548f7d9309220cd3c5ba/tenor.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:inherit;">link</a> in the group chat and only briefly explained it; that sounds like him. Let me give you a little more info on this whole predicament<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:inherit;">.</a></p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>Who:</b> I mean if you got sent this, then you! Not only are you personally invited but any family you wish to bring can come along too.</p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>What:</b> A campfire get together with fire, food, and games.</p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>When:</b> It will be from 6:30pm to 10pm, and if you wish to leave sooner you may. The date will be chosen based on availability. Please go to the following <a href="http://whenisgood.net/75mc59i" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a> and choose all the days that work for you.</p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>Where:</b> Nice try but I'm not posting my home address on the internet. Hopefully future Hans remembered to include our address in the text he sent with this website.</p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>Why:</b> Idk dude I just wanted to have a little get together and I figured it would be fun.</p>
      <p class="w3-red fivews"><b>Warning:</b> Alcohol is not allowed, but if you only drink Dr. Pepper and are worried we won't have it you can bring you own soda.</p>
      <p class="w3-red fivews"><b>Warning:</b> No swearing either all profanity should be left for the potholes you drive over on the way home.</p>
      <p class="fivews">Hopefully that explained a little bit about whats happening but just because I'm so nice I'll write a little extra about the event.  Because we can only fit so many cars in our driveway we would like for parking to be done in the East part of the Western Merrill Park's parking strip. We have an outside area and a screened in porch, but the screened in area can only hold so many people and will probably be protecting the food from insects, so most interactions will be held outside. There is a restroom that is easily accessible inside, and is not in a creepy basement.</p>
      <p class="fivews">There are some things that you can bring if you want but most everything should be available. There will be chairs provided and they will be a mix of patio chairs, benches, and folding chairs, but if you have a chair you love you can bring your own. Same as chairs yard games and card games will be provided but if you have a game you feel needs to be shared feel free to bring it along. Some foods will be provided (hot dogs, chips, and smores), but if you would like to bring something be our guest.</p>
      <p class="fivews">There will be a speaker playing some music from a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/594mQLBZUpHEuOhi65mBH8?si=7a13e97670054033" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spotify playlist</a> that is collaborative so feel free to add a song or six. Please be sure these songs are family friendly and rather general in genre. If you don't have a spotify account and want to add a song just use the iPad at LC, or send you requests to Hans.</p>
      <p class="fivews"><b>TLDR:</b> If you want to bring anything feel free, but don't feel like you need to bring anything. You will be parking in the Eastern segment of West Merrill's parking strip and walking over to our backyard from there.</p>
      <p class="fivews" style="padding-bottom:10px">If you have any questions please feel free to ask, and if you need any help finding the place call Hans and he can help direct you.</p>
