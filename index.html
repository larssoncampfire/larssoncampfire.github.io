    <div class="w3-orange">
      <p class="fivews" style="margin-top:0px;padding-top:15px;">So Hans popped this <a href="https://media.tenor.com/images/4ab2809b691e548f7d9309220cd3c5ba/tenor.gif" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:inherit;">link</a> in the group chat and only briefly explained it; that sounds like him. Let me give you a little more info on this whole predicament<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demon_core" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style="text-decoration:inherit;">.</a></p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>Who:</b> I mean if you got sent this, then you! Not only are you personally invited but any family you wish to bring can come along too.</p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>What:</b> A campfire get together with fire, food, and games.</p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>When:</b> It will be from 7pm to 10pm, but as for the date that's not decided yet. To help just go to the following <a href="#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">link</a>(this link doesn't work yet) and choose the days that work for you.</p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>Where:</b> Nice try but I'm not posting my home address on the internet. However I will try to remember to put an image of my home on here, and I will send my address to the group chat.</p>
      <p class="w3-amber fivews"><b>Why:</b> Idk dude I just wanted to have a little get together and I figured it would be fun.</p>
      <p class="w3-red fivews"><b>Warning:</b> Alcohol is not prohibited, but if you only drink Dr. Pepper and are worried we won't have it you can bring you own soda.</p>
      <p class="w3-red fivews"><b>Warning:</b> No swearing either all profanity should be left for the potholes you drive over on the way home.</p>
      <p class="fivews">Hopefully that explained a little bit about whats happening but just because I'm so nice I'll write a little extra about the event.  Because we can only fit so many cars in our driveway we would like for parking to be done in the east part of the western Merrill Park's parking strip. We have an outside area and a screened in porch, but the screened in area can only hold so many people and will probably be protecting the food from insects, so most interactions will be held outside.</p>
      <p class="fivews">There are some things that you can bring if you want but most everything should be available if people want. There will be chairs provided and they will be a mix of patio chairs, benches, and folding chairs, but if you have a chair you love you can bring your own. Same as chairs yard games and card games will be provided but if you have a game you feel needs to be shared feel free to bring it along. Some foods will be provided (hot dogs, chips, and smores), but if you would like to bring something be our guest.</p>
      <p class="fivews" style="padding-bottom:10px">If you have any questions please feel free to ask, and if you need any help finding the place call Hans and he can help direct you.</p>
